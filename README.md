# Rafael Karcz's Python Projects

Welcome to my repository of Python practice tasks and little projects! Here, I've collected a series of small projects that I've worked on to help me learn and develop my Python skills.

## Getting Started
To run any of the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

Alternatively you can also give it a try with Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/

Once you have Python installed, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the Python script of your choice from the command line. For example:

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/RafaelKarcz/karatsu_projects.git
$ cd karatsu_projects
$ python stack.py
</code></pre>

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions for additional Python practice tasks or projects that I should tackle, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and improve my Python skills!
